# GoodBots
Curated lists of IP addresses/whitelists of good bots and crawlers. Includes GoogleBot, BingBot, DuckDuckBot, etc.

Either use the [all.ips](all.ips) list or a specific service's list of IP-Addresses found in the [iplists/](iplists/) directory.

The lists are updated daily via a scheduled GitHub Action.
